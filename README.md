# *Simplified* Car Rental Application

### *Project made by Okasha Huda*


- **What will the application do?**
  - this application will be a simple car rental application. user will have the option  
  to select a car to rent, choose when to pick up the car and when to drop off the car.  
  the user will then be able to save the booking and come back to it to make any  
  changes.


- **Who will use it?**
  - this project is made for fun, but if it were to be scaled, then potentially large or small  
  rental car companies can implement a similar design. the idea can also be manipulated  
  to incorporate hotels or flights and if scaled even further can turn into vacation booking  
  application.


- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
  - I like the idea of this project because I just have an interest in cars and driving cars in  
  general. other than that, this project is a good way to showcase what I have learned.
